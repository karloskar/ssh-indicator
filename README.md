ssh-indicator
=============
A python application to get an Ubuntu Indicator overview of active ssh
connections. Also with the ability to connect to different ssh hosts based
on your ssh config file.

A lot is hardcoded to fit my ssh multiplexing settings and may or may not be
fixed. If you have any interest in using this please let me know and I'll help
you get going.
